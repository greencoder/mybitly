# My bitly
A demo iOS application using the [bit.ly API](dev.bitly.com).

## Instructions

To run the application, double-click the (My%20Bitly.xcworkspace) file. Do not click the (My%20Bitly.xcodeproj) file, it will not load the dependancies properly.

## Running Xcode Unit Tests

There is a mock API server written in Python in the (Test Server) directory. All the dependent libraries are included locally:
```
cd Test\ Server
$ python server.py
```

Once the mock server is running, you can run the unit tests in Xcode using the menu item *Product > Test*. 

Note that the unit tests will *not* hit the live bit.ly API.
